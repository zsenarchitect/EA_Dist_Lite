## Files Optimized

### 1. `warnings_checks.py` ✅
**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **Set-based GUID lookup** for O(1) critical warning identification (was O(n))
- ✅ **Worksharing check** before attempting to get WorksharingUtils (avoids unnecessary API calls)
- ✅ **Direct dict.get()** for dictionary updates instead of checking membership first
- ✅ **ElementId handling** that works with both ElementId objects and raw IDs

## Best Practices Applied

### ✅ Revit API Best Practices
1. **Single collector calls** where possible
2. **WhereElement filtering** before ToElements()
3. **IntegerValue for set operations** (faster than ElementId comparisons)
4. **Worksharing checks** before WorksharingUtils calls
5. **BuiltInCategory** instead of string matching
6. **InvalidElementId checks** before doc.GetElement
7. **Enum comparisons** instead of string comparisons
8. **Element caching** to reduce API calls

### ✅ Python Performance Best Practices
1. **Set-based lookups** O(1) instead of list O(n)
2. **Single-pass iterations** instead of multiple loops
3. **Dict.get() with defaults** instead of membership checks
4. **Early returns** for empty collections
5. **Caching frequently accessed elements**
6. **List comprehensions** for filtering

### ✅ Error Handling Best Practices
1. **Specific error keys** for debugging
2. **Graceful degradation** (return empty dicts instead of None)
3. **Try-except at appropriate granularity**
4. **Preserved partial results** on error
5. **Floating point precision** handling

    "detail_lines_total": 0,
    ...
}

# AFTER (optimized)
{
    "unplaced_rooms": 0,              # SAME KEY
    "detail_lines_total": 0,          # SAME KEY
    "unplaced_room_details": [...],   # NEW (optional)
