    Sanitize names for export to Revit by removing/replacing forbidden characters.
    
    This function handles all forbidden characters that can cause issues when exporting
    from Rhino to Revit, including block names and layer names.
    
    Args:
        name (str): Original name to sanitize
        replacement_char (str): Character to replace forbidden characters with. Defaults to "_"
        log_changes (bool): Whether to log when names are changed. Defaults to True
        
    Returns:
        str: Sanitized name safe for Revit export
        
    Examples:
        >>> sanitize_name_for_export("Block:Name[1]")
        'Block_Name_1_'
        >>> sanitize_name_for_export("Layer\\Path")
